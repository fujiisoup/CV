### Research Summary
I am interested in machine learning and Bayesian inference methods for big science, in particular plasma fusion experiment.
I have been originally working with diagnostic instruments for plasma fusion study.
One of my current objective is the accuracy improvement of scientific diagnostics, which is often suffered from complex noise, by machine learning and Bayesian inference.
In my first attempt [K. Fujii 2016 RSI], I inferred systematic noise of instruments from experimental data.

I have been previously working for spectroscopic diagnostics of the fusion plasma.
My main contribution for the spectroscopic field is
+ I found the far tails of the Balmer series spectrum in high temperature hydrogen plasma and
found that this tails originate from the high temperature (a few keV) neutral hydrogen atoms.  
[K.Fujii 2013 Phys. Plasmas]

+ I have developed a method to measure such far spectrum with dynamic range 10^6.  
[K.Fujii 2013 Rev. Sci. Instrum]

+ I have developed an inference model of neutral hydrogen density distribution in the core region of the high temperature plasma based on the spectral profile inversion.
