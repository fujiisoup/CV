### Research Summary

I am interested in atomic physics, plasma physics, statistical physics as well as machine learning.
Because of many-body interaction inside atoms or in plasmas, they show rich structures by themselves.
My interest is on *statistically* modeling such complex phenomena.

Followings are some selected works.

+ I reported a simple explanation for a long standing question about the line intensity distribution from many-electron atoms.  
[https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.124.185002](K. Fujii PRL2020)

+ I showed a similar property in the $\gamma$-ray strength distribution from nuclear reaction, which has $10^8$ times higher energy scale than atoms.
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11844](arXiv:2005.11844)

+ I have developed a data-driven calibration method of Thomson-scattering system in fusion plasma experiments, where its non-linear signal processing principle results in heavily skewed noise distribution and makes it difficult to estimate the true values.  
[K. Fujii RSI 2017]

+ I have developed an inference model of neutral hydrogen density distribution in the core region of the high temperature plasma based on the spectral profile inversion.
