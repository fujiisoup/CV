### Research Summary

I am interested in atomic physics, plasma physics, statistical physics as well as machine learning.
Many-body interactions inside atoms and in plasmas, these systems show rich structures by themselves.
My interest is on *statistically* modeling such complex phenomena.

#### Statistical modeling of quantum structure of many-electron-atoms and heavy nucleus

I reported a simple explanation for a long standing question about the line intensity distribution from many-electron atoms.

I also found the similar phenomena in nuclear emission ($\gamma$-decay spectrum).
The intensity statistics of $\gamma$-decay spectrum becomes also a power-law but with a specific power-law-index of 1, regardless of the reaction kind or neuclei.

#### Statistical method to improve fusion plasma experiment 

I have developed a data-driven calibration method of Thomson-scattering system in fusion plasma experiments, where its non-linear signal processing principle results in heavily skewed noise distribution and makes it difficult to estimate the true values.  
[K. Fujii RSI 2017]

Also, I have developed an inference model of neutral hydrogen density distribution in the core region of the high temperature plasma based on the spectral profile inversion.  
Furthermore, we found that the neutral hydrogen density distribution in the core plasma can be understood from thermo-mechanical view point; the pressure of atoms is almost constant over the core to edge region, while the huge temperature difference makes the density difference.
